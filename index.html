                    <p class="text-small">
                        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

                        Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
                        recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require
                        medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular
                        disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious
                        illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. <br><br>

                        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and
                        how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre
                        apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an
                        alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when itâ€™s your turn and follow local
                        guidance.<br><br>

                        The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they
                        cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to
                        smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing
                        into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.
